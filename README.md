# ohi-shiny2

**Update (2016-10-12):** This Shiny app got moved to [ohirepos/inst/app at master Â· OHI-Science/ohirepos](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohirepos/tree/master/inst/app).

Since attending [#shinydevcon](https://www.rstudio.com/shinydevcon/), couldn't help applying newfound knowledge towards updating OHI Shiny app, particularly for [ohi-global](http://ohi-science.nceas.ucsb.edu/ohi-global/) and in anticipation of porting Herman's htmlwidget of [ohi-aster](https://github.com/FrissAnalytics/ohi-aster).

See the [live **demo**: ![](screenshot.png)](https://bdbest.shinyapps.io/ohi-shiny2/).

This implementation uses:

- [shinydashboard](http://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/)
- [leaflet](http://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/)
- [R powered web applications with Shiny (a tutorial and cheat sheet with 40 example apps) | Technical Tidbits From Spatial Analysis & Data Science](http://zevross.com/blog/2016/04/19/r-powered-web-applications-with-shiny-a-tutorial-and-cheat-sheet-with-40-example-apps/)

The high resolution global EEZ shapefile was greatly simplified with the excellent [`rmapshaper::ms_simplify`](https://github.com/ateucher/rmapshaper#usage). See [prep_rgns.Rmd](prep_rgns.Rmd) for specifics.
